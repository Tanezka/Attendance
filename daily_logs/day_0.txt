Hi i am Tanez.

This is an attendence tracker project about Albion Online.
I am doing this because tracking attendence is a chore in Albion and i see the spark. It can be automated.

In short term i want this project to be functional semi-automatic.
In the long term it can be fully automated it can even made into a discord bot.

Currently i have some basic developer skills like:
- read docs
- learning a new coding language
- Creating algorithms from scratch
- C, C++, C#, and a little bit of javascript

My current weak spots are
- Time management
- Sleep Schedule

Starting today i want to build a momentum. I am starting with 3 hour a day and in the long term i want to go as far as 8-9 hours a day of pure work and no distractions.
